# RoboND-gazebo-ball-chaser
A simple project using ROS and Gazebo to simulate a robot following a ball in a virtual building environment. The Robot has an RGB camera and a LIDAR sensor. The point cloud generated by the LIDAR is visualized in RViz. The white ball is detected by the camera and appropriate movement commands (linear and angular velocities) are sent to the motors.

The following is a sample video that shows what the simulation looks like:

### Frameworks and Tools used
 - Robot Operation System (ROS) - Versions Kinetic / Melodic
 - Gazebo
 - RViz
 - Unified Robot Description Format

### Installation
Copy and cd to /root/catkin_ws
source devel/setup.bash
catkin_make

### Launch
cd /root/catkin_ws
Terminal 1 : roslaunch my_robot world.launch
Terminal 2 : roslaunch ball_chaser ball_chaser.launch

## Robot Model Description
A differential drive robot (containing a chassis, two castor wheels, and two wheels) defined using the Unified Robot Description Format. It contains two sensors: a lidar and a camera. This project also uses Gazebo plugins for the robot’s differential drive, lidar, and camera.
